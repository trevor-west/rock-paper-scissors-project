/* BEGIN 1. UNDERSTANDING (Problem Outline and Strategy)

Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors, The Odin Project game! 
 The point of this program is to simulate the classic rock,
 paper, scissors game that most played as kids.

 I will be following the 'Programmer Mindset' philosophy
 to problem solving which involves doing 3 main things
 when approaching a problem (and specifically a coding
 problem):

 First: Understand the problem. (I am doing this here in
    this larger introductory comment section);

 Second: Plan (I will do this by outlining more specific
    comments of everything the code needs to do, based
    on my understanding as outlined in this introductory
    comment section)

 Third: Break down (I will do this by translating the parts
    of comments to code that are easiest)

 So far, in learning more about coding, and having a
 background in Japanese-English translation, I have come
 to view programming to be less a matter of "speaking" a
 foreign language so much as translating between human
 logic and computer logic; from human language and desire
 to computer language and execution. So to "solve" a coding
 problem seems to me to require an adequate "translation."

 As for the game of rock-paper-scissors itself:
 
 The basic rules are simple:
 1. Rock beats scissors
 2. Scissor beats paper
 3. Paper beats rock.
 
 The extent of this project is to create variables to store
 the inputs from both the player who will be inputting his
 or her choice of rock, scissor, or paper; he or she will
 be playing against a computer (function) that will 
 randomly generate a numerical value that will be assigned
 rock, scissor, or paper in a random 1/3 chance ratio.
 
 Upon the player beating the computer, a simple "Yay!
 You won~!" message will be printed, and upon losing a
 simple "Oh no, the computer won :(" message will be
 printed.
 
 That sums up the basic understanding of the problem,
 next will be for outlining each step of the code in
 comments as part of phase 2: Planning.*/


 /* BEGIN 2. PLAN (Comment outlining of everything needed)*/

 // Create a variable to store player's choice
let playerSelection;

 // Create a variable to store computer's choice
 let computerChoice;


 // Create function computerPlay and use the stored random
 // value to determine rock, paper, or scissors.
 // Ensure that this function is repeated at the end/start
 // of each new round so that the computer always has a 
 // different value (so game doesn't suck/isn't predictable every time)


 // Create a function to randomly generate a random value
 

 // Create variables to associate the same numerial value
 // ranges with rock, paper, scissors (in such a way as to equal 1/3)


 // Create an if loop to determine if player of computer wins

 // Print out a "Yay~! You won!" message (part of loop)

 // Print out a "Oh no! You lost to the computer :(" message
 // (part if loop)
